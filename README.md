## Gareth Harris


I have recently graduated from Makers Academy coding bootcamp and am seeking my first Junior Developer role.

I have over 10 years of experience working in the fields of web management, business analysis, 1st line systems support and training. However, in recent months, I have focused on study in order to transition into a more technical role. 

After experiencing the immence satisfaction of completing projects while learning mobile app development using Dart and Flutter, I decided to sign up for Makers Academy so I could make the transition into a more technical role.

## Skills

#### Web Developement

Over 10 years experience maintaining websites for an international audience. Primarily using content management systsems, but also HTML, CSS and Javascript when required. 
While studing at Makers Academy, I also gained further skills in Ruby on Rails and improved in my Javascript abilities.

#### Flutter / Dart

Before signing up for Makers Academy, I completed an online course on mobile app development using Flutter and Dart. I have contintued to use what I learned in personal projects.

#### Japanese Language (conversational level)

I am comfortable communicating in Japanese at a conversational level and have achieved level N3 of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test.
